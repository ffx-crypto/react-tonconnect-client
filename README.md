This is a client-side application for FFX Crypto project. The main function of this app is to implement simple ICO - users send **ton** and recieve corresponding **jetton** amount. The project is based on the [allen-hsu/demo-waitin-tx](https://github.com/allen-hsu/demo-waiting-tx) app.

## Contributing 
I will be happy for your interest in the project. Contributions are required and welcomed.

## ToDo List: 
- *health check* - application should request the server before activating **JSalesInput** component 
- *support for NFT* - currently there is only jetton on the **Sale** page, but in the future NFTs will appear as well
- support for *TMA* ([telegram mini app](https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/dapps/tma/overview)) - application will have a version for **telegram** or wallets like **tonkeeper** - when application is opened on a mobile device it should redirect user to the telegram/tonkeeper (?)
- *testing* and *improvements* - there are no unit or end2end tests for the application, also i will be happy to proposed improvemens or corrections
- *theming* - currently application has only light theme, it should also have a *dark* one with possibility to switch between them
- *localization (L10n)* - the project needs texts and translations
